        <h3>READING: What Hypertext Is? By Noah Wardrip-Fruin</h3>
        <p>
            From the reading, I gathered that hypertext is essentially a form of media that includes a variety of ways in which text can be utilised. 
            From the scientific perspective, hypertext focuses or relates more towards machine learning and interaction upon request. 
            Wardrip goes on to state that Theodor Holm “Ted” Nelson coined the term Hypertext and was the one who basically defined it as a form of media. 
            Me reading this article made me a bit confused as to what was actually being talked about so I did some side research. 
            According to Technopedia and (please dont shoot me, I really needed an answer) Wikipedia, I was able to deduce that the hypertext being referred to is the current coding language we are being taught to use. 
            Hypertext is basically a language that utilises hyperlinks that are able to display and join different types of media. 
            It’s called a language due to its sequencing and arguments it poses when being used to create a line or paragraph of code. 
            There are similarities to be drawn to other forms of media as presented by Fruin, mainly designing. 
            In order for the hypertext to generate an outcome, one must first have an initial thought or design as to how the end product or result from the text will generate. 
            Same as other forms of media whereby the process has to be mapped out first before the procedure.

        <h3>OVERALL REVIEW OF WEEK 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Week one was mainly focused on setting up and getting to know what html is and how to best utilise it. 
            I had a bit of trouble with setting up GitHub, specifically with linking my account to the school account in order for it to appear on the lecturers end. 
            The main goal for the week was to complete the set up and to start brainstorming ideas on how to best conduct the wireframing of our websites and what we want them to look like. 
            Weaknesses I have so far mostly revolve around GitHub and the online set up but everything else wasnt as bad, especially visual studios. 
            I am personally looking forward to planning out the wireframes and building the website. I feel like with enough time, I'll be able to make a good website and have a steady understanding of GitHub. 
            I'm also looking forward to learning about CSS and styling to make the site more colourful.

            <h2>BLOG POST 2: INTERACTION AND THE WWW</h2>

            <h3>READING: Moulthrop - 2003 - You Say You Want a Revolution Hypertext and the Laws of Media</h3>
            <p>
                This reading, to me, seemed like a continuation from the reading I chose for week 1. 
                It’s still explaining or rather reiterating what hypertext is, except in this reading it is further expanded upon. 
                Moulthrop expands on this argument by exploring the concept of hypertext, a technology allowing non-linear access to information. 
                He discusses its historical development, from early concepts by Vannevar Bush to Theodor Holm Nelson's ambitious project, Xanadu. 
                Moulthrop reflects on the reception of hypertext, its potential societal impact, and the challenges in realizing its full potential. 
                He considers the cyclic nature of technological trends and the perpetual desire for the "next big thing" in postmodern culture. 
                Moulthrop also raises questions about the political and social implications of hypertextual societies, including issues of authority and access. 
                Overall, he prompts readers to critically engage with the implications of hypertextual technologies for culture, politics, and social order. 
                From this reading I have gathered that Moulthrop, Nelson and Fruin all expand hypertext as a form of media. 
                Moulthrop, however, explores the options of the outputs that come from inputting something in the hypertext. 
                Each subheading describes either actions or inputs that can be used by the hypertext. 
                These subheadings include phrases such as “What does hypertext enhance or intensify?”, “What does hypertext displace or render obsolete?”, “What does hypertext become when taken to its limit?”. 
                These are questions that could be answered by actually inputting something to hypertext to generate an answer. However there’s also a lingering feeling of fear when Moulthrop asks these questions. 
                It feels as though there is an underlying warning about the dangers of expanding hypertext or using it in an unethical manner.

            <h3>LECTURE VIDEO AND SLIDES: </h3>
            <p>
                The lecture video was based on Human Centred Design and how to create reasonable and ethical designs. 
                The video mainly talked about the designs of doors and how majority of the doors are designed with aesthetic in mind instead of functionality. 
                Through highlighting the importance of good door designs to combat the shitty ones that are quite frankly everywhere, I was able to get the understanding of creating good UI and good hypertext navigation is vital for good user Experience. 
                The lecture slides highlighted the importance of links, inputs, and outputs. In order for a hypertext site to be interesting, there must be areas of input and output to keep the user engaged. 
                Some inputs and outputs include Mouse Events (click), UI (scroll) and others.

            <h3>WEEKLY PROGRESS</h3>
            <p>
                This week I have started gathering ideas on how to structure the website. I have drawn up a few wireframes to illustrate how I want my website to look. 
                I have already started using links and some semantics on my website but I am more focused on the functionality of my site and the style guide.
            </p>

            <time datetime="2024-03-01"> 1 March 2024</time>
            <h3>LECTURE AND WEEKLY PROGRESS</h3>
            <p>
                In the lecture video, a range of topics were covered. These topics spanned from the use of Git and Github setup to Dom trees and document Structures. 
                Overall what I got from the video was that semantic markup is basically the practice of using HTML elements to accurately represent the meaning and structure of content on a webpage. 
                I wasn’t quite sure about how to use them and what they were but I was able to use the video as a guide after figuring stuff out by myself using MDN documents and W3 school. 
                I now understand that Semantic markups improve the readability and maintainability of the code.  Learning about the DOM tree put thing into perspective because it made structuring my website a bit easier now knowing what goes where. 
                I also changed from using a lot of sections to using articles for my blog post structuring. I removed a bunch navs in order to make the code neater, taking some advice I have received from an IM 4th year lecturer. 
                I utilised the header system due to the fact that we haven’t really started with css yet and I almost made the mistake of using h1 for every heading I had in order to make them bold and big. 
                Overall there were a lot of changes made from my initial website that I was building last week but in terms of structuring, I feel like I have made good improvements. 
                I have missed a couple of in class lectures but I made up for it by exploring more tags and markups. I included a time tag that tells the date of the different blog posts written and used the h3 for sub headings and h2 for each week’s title.

            <h2>BLOG POST 4: The IxD Process / Headers and Microformats</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-03-08"> 8 March 2024</time>
            <h3>LECTURE MATERIAL</h3>
            <p>
                Going off on what was said last week in the lecture video, this lecture goes on to specify the importance of Document structure and planning. It also explores Headers and formatting, specifically the http and url schemes. 
                In this module, we have already explored the url scheme in the first week when setting up Github. We had to create a directory that could lead us to the Interactive media 3 section in github and add it onto our url. 
                I am still somewhat confused about the naming convention because I did it wrong and only saw a couple of days later that I didn’t use an underscore but used it for the repository that I didn’t add on the IM3 section. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The IxD process was a bit tricky to understand but I inevitably tried my best to do what I thought was being asked of me. I created 2 diagrams that showed the relationship or interaction between my pages. 
                I only covered the main 3 which are the Blog, Design, and Home pages. I did a semi detailed description of each page and what it contains. I thought I would better explain it here instead of a drawing.
            </p>
            <h3>IXD PROCESS DIAGRAM</h3>
            <p>
                So in this diagram I made the root of everything the home page because that’s the first page to pop up when opening the site. Its also the first page to experience changes on the developer side. 
                Within my home page I will first display the title, then information and the links to the next pages. I forgot to draw in that I meant links in the navbar that display the different pages when clicked. 
                I also forgot to add the footer for most pages in the diagram. I plan on including my details and information in the footer as opposed to my original wireframe idea which was to add the navbar there as well, following the apple website design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Blog post section will go under iteration seeing as we haven’t really gotten to css yet but I intend to follow the wireframes to the t. There will be 2 pages for the blog posts, one will be the main display page, the other will expand upon the blog in great detail.
