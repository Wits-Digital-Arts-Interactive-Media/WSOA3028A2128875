        <h1>Design</h1>
        <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <p>
            I designed these wireframes for both website and mobile screen so that it would be easier to implement when it's time to make the website responsive.
            I have three pages done so far, the Home,Design and Blog pages. I started with these because these are the ones I have worked on so far.
            I will continue with the other frames when they are compulsory.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did 2 sections. One is the low perosity wireframe which includes basic shapes and shades of grey to indicate where everything will go.
            The other one includes the deatails of the page and how it will look. The light grey squares indicate the header and the footer which is where nav bars 
            and other information will go. The darker shades will indicate information. The darkest shade or black, will show the blog post images.

        <h2>Websites and inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            I drew inspiration from the apple website with how simplistic it is and how straightforward the UI and navigation are.

        <h2>IxD Process</h2>
        <p>
            My IxD process is best illustrated in this image below. I have already established this process in the Week 4 blog.
